# Suyu but a flake
A way to install the [Suyu](https://gitlab.com/suyu-emu/suyu) emulator in NixOS. Takes a lot from the NixOS yuzu package.


## How to use
Add the flake as an input to your nixos setup. Add it to your packages. If you don't know how to use nix flakes, I recommend [this guide](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes)
